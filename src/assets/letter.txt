Each night that Nina and I spent together going back to the first (okay second) night, we would take the subway into NYC for work the next morning where I would get off the train just one stop sooner than she did. I got into a habit of taking photos of her from the subway platform. Why? I’m not really sure. I didn’t really know what I was doing at the time nor did I have any sort of motive. I just did. I started building a website of all of this. It’s probably some of the cleanest code that I’ve ever written. It can all be found on github if that peaks your interest. It was built with VueJS using Netlify and Are.na. I hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed building it.
