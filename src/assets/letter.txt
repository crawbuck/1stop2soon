Nina and I met on November 6th, 2019. Since that night(okay, second night), we found ourselves going together work together every morning where I'd get off the subway just one stop sooner than she did. I didn't realize it at the time or had a plan to be doing any of this. But I have taken over 40 photos of her from what has always felt like, one stop too soon.
