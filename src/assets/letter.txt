I often found myself looking for love. I think in a lot of ways that’s why a lot of my romantic endeavors never quite worked out. If you met me in October and asked me what I was looking for as we so frequently do, I wanted to be single. I had a rough year — and I wanted to take some time to myself to go through whatever I was thinking or feeling without the regard of how that might look to someone else. In November, I met someone. By December she made me forget that I even had a plan for myself. And by January, I learned that she was moving back home to Australia. The last few months have been nothing shy of what honestly feels like an episode of 90 day fiancé full of laughter, spontaneity, bad attempts at the Australian accent, falling off bar stools at Rocka Rolla, and above all, love. It’s a strange thing to approach a relationship fully knowing that it is going to end. I guess all relationships at some point in time end by choice or by death. But yet, we often find ourselves with blind romanticism with this idea of forever. But seeing Nina, despite the fact that our situation was perhaps unfavorable to my own selfish interests, I gained an indescribable moment and memories I’ll never give up. 


Each night that Nina and I spent together going back to the first (okay second) night, we would take the subway into NYC for work the next morning where I would get off the train just one stop sooner than she did.
